# Introduction
This document is included in the 'Recommending Extract Method Refactoring Opportunities via Multi-view Representation of Code Property Graph' distribution，which we will refer to as REMS，This is to distinguish the recommended implementation of this Extract method refactoring from other implementations.https://anonymous.4open.science/r/REMS-8940 In this document, the environment required to make and use the REMS tool is described. Some hints about the installation environment are here, but users need to find complete instructions from other sources. They give a more detailed description of their tools and instructions for using them. My main environment is located on a computer with windows (windows 10 at the time of my writing) operating system. The fundamentals should be similar for other platforms, although the way in which the environment is configured will be different. What do I mean by environment? For example, to run python code you will need to install a python interpreter, and if you want to use node2vec you will need tensorflow.
